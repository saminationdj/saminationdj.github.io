	Information about me, my mixes and other miscellaneous stuff will appear 
	here.<br />
	<br />
	But here are some quick bits:<br />
	<br />
	<em class="h3">Who am I?</em><br />
	I am a guy from Sweden, who around 2001-2002 fell in love with a genre 
	dubbed Happy Hardcore. A year later I started burning tracks to CDs, and to 
	be able to fit as many tracks as possible, I started using programs such as 
	AtomixMP3 (which was later renamed virtualDJ). So that's kinda how I started 
	mixing, and ever since, I've shared my results for other people to listen 
	to.<br />
	<br />
	<em class="h3">Why are most of my newer mixes in OGG format?</em><br />
	The Vorbis codec (which extension is usually named .ogg) allows for higher 
	bitrate than MP3 files (at least without heavy modification, and thus 
	breaking compatibility), in sense keeping more of the original quality as 
	possible (unless the sources are MP3 that is).<br />
	<br />
	Most PC platforms and software should have no issues supporting this format, 
	not even iOS such as iPhones or iPads (although 3rd party programs such as 
	foobar2000 and VOX might be needed to play the files).<br />
	<br />
	Most of my older mixes are still in MP3 format though, but most are only 
	192kbps, which is kinda low, hence the so called Revisisted mixes.<br />
	<br />
	<em class="h3">On that subject, what's the deal with the Revisisted mixes?</em><br />
	The biggest reason with these re-recorded mixes is to preserve the mixes at 
	a higher quality. In some cases is because I managed to find enough higher 
	quality tracks to warrant it, or I just wanted to redo it (but in some cases 
	I might've just made it worse, haha).<br />
	<br />
	<em class="h3">What is .CUE?</em><br />
	Cue Sheets (.cue) is part of a format for burning CDs. These files are 
	mostly used together with CD Images (.img), but has been tooled to also work 
	with Audio-CDs. Cue Sheets makes it easier to burn to CD with timestamps, or 
	when using software that supports them (for example foobar2000).<br />
	<br />
	<strong>NOTE</strong>: The .cue will work with most audio files when using 
	software to play them back. But if you wish to burn them, the ones that come 
	with .ogg files MIGHT NOT work. I have not personally tried burning them, so 
	be warned. To make it work might require transcoding the .ogg to .wav and 
	editing of the .cue file, which I will sadly not go through here.<br />
